During this upgrade process, we need the participation of all members for testing. Since our operations are based on blockchain technology and do not involve any centralized modules, each upgrade requires the contract to re-recognize your referral network. We kindly ask for your cooperation in completing this process and hope for your continued support for the foundation's development. We firmly believe that the foundation will deliver a brand-new blockchain betting system in the future, providing everyone with an even better experience! Vegas Foundation Technical Department",
