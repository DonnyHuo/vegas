Family members who experienced loss of principal on their first bet, please send 1 USDT to the official payment address, and we will refund the principal to your earnings address. The V2 beta version has disabled reinvestment, direct referral earnings, and differential earnings. All family members are requested to use the official version for betting, which recognizes network relationships. Earnings will function normally, while differential earnings will be gradually opened by generation (3rd, 7th, 10th, and 15th) in the following month. We hope to provide you with a pleasant experience. Wishing everyone happy betting! - Vegas Foundation Technical Department",
